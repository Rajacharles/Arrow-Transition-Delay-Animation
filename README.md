CSS animations and transitions can personalize your site and create delightful experiences for your visitors. When a website visitor hovers over an animated element like a link or button, for example, it can change color,  grow, shrink, rotate, and more, depending on how you coded it. This is enjoyable for the visitor and shows that your site is working.
